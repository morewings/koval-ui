# Toast

## Description

`Toast` is a small, non-intrusive notification that appears temporarily on the screen to provide feedback to the user. It is used to display brief messages, such as success, error, or informational alerts, without interrupting the user's workflow. Toasts appear at the bottom of the screen and can optionally automatically disappear after a short duration.
